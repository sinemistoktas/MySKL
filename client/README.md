# My React Flask App

This project is a full-stack application that uses React for the frontend and Flask for the backend. Below are the instructions for setting up and running the client-side of the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the client directory:

   ```
   cd my-react-flask-app/client
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the React application, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. The app will automatically reload if you make edits.

### Folder Structure

- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file for the React application.
- `src/App.js`: The main component of the React application.
- `src/index.js`: The entry point for the React application.
- `src/components/ExampleComponent.js`: A functional component for displaying specific content.

### Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build of the app in the `build` folder.
