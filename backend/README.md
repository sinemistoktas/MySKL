2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
   It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Flask Application**
   Start the Flask server.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
