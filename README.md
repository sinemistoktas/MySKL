Project Idea:
Our project MySKL aims for people to choose their time intervals throughout the day to study in the library and match those people with others with the opposite schedule so that they can both study on that day by using only one place. After the day finishes, both people rank their experience so that when choosing a person to share a desk, people can know how liable they are (e.g., if someone agrees with someone but the other person leaves the table without their pair, they can be ranked low).
